# Installation

## From a package manager

Alt-ergo is available on [opam], the ocaml package manager with the following command :
```console
opam install alt-ergo
```

This command will install the Alt-ergo library `alt-ergo-lib` and the parsers `alt-ergo-parsers`, as well as other librairies detailled in [dependencies](#dependencies).

Since version 2.6.0, Alt-Ergo is compatible with opam 2.2 installations using both Cygwin and MSYS2 on Windows. To setup opam on Windows, please follow the instructions [here](https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2024_07_01_opam_2_2_0_releases/).

## From GitHub releases (Linux and macOS)

For convenience, binary releases for Linux and macOS (amd64 and arm64) of
Alt-Ergo are provided on the GitHub release page. These binary releases are
statically linked and very portable. They are distributed under the same
licensing restrictions as the source code.

following libraries :
```
  ocaml >= 4.08.1
  dune >= 3.0
  dune-build-info
  dune-site
  dolmen >= 0.10
  dolmen_type >= 0.10
  dolmen_loop >= 0.10

  menhir
  dune-site
  cmdliner >= 1.1.0
  psmt2-frontend >= 0.4
  stdlib-shims
  ppx_deriving
```

You can install dependencies using:

```console
$ make deps
```

and create a development switch with:

```console
$ make dev-switch
```

### Build and Install

The steps below will build and install native or bytecode binaries
depending on whether ocamlopt is installed or only ocamlc is detected.

Note: these are somewhat obsolete; nowadays you can just use `dune`

#### Everything (binaries, plugins, library, ...)

  1. Compile with `make`

  2. Install with `make install-all`

  3. Uninstall with `make uninstall-all`

#### Alt-Ergo library

  1. Compile with `make alt-ergo-lib`

  2. Install with `make install-lib`

#### Alt-Ergo parsers

  1. Compile with `make alt-ergo-parsers`

  2. Install with `make install-parsers`

#### Alt-Ergo binary

  1. Compile with `make alt-ergo`

  2. Install with `make install-bin`

#### Alt-Ergo with Nodejs

You can install dependencies using:

```
$ make js-deps
```

  1. Compile with `make js-node`

For this build rule you will need the following aditional libraries :
```
js_of_ocaml >= 5.4.0
zarith_stubs_js >= v0.16.1
```

#### Alt-Ergo web worker

  1. Compile with `make js-worker`

For this build rule you will need the following aditional libraries :
```
js_of_ocaml >= 5.4.0
js_of_ocaml-lwt
zarith_stubs_js >= v0.16.1
data-encoding
```

#### Alt-Ergo web worker small example

  1. Compile with `make js-example`

This command create a `www/` directory in which you can find a small js example running in the `index.html` file

For this build rule you will need the following aditional libraries :
```
js_of_ocaml >= 5.4.0
js_of_ocaml-lwt
js_of_ocaml-ppx
lwt_ppx
zarith_stubs_js >= v0.16.1
data-encoding
```

### Plugins

The steps below will build and install additional plugins (extension
.cmxs if ocamlopt is installed or .cma if only ocamlc is detected).

#### The SatML Plugin

 satML is now inlined and compiled directly with Alt-Ergo's source code

#### The Fm-Simplex Plugin

  1. Compile with `make fm-simplex`

  2. The Fm-Simplex plugin is currently built and installed
  at the same time as the alt-ergo binary.

#### The AB-Why3 parser plugin

  1. Compile with `make AB-Why3`

  2. The AB-Why3 plugin is currently built and installed
  at the same time as the alt-ergo binary.

You can find more information in the [AB-Why3 README]

#### The profiler plugin

This plugin has been "inlined" in Alt-Ergo sources.
