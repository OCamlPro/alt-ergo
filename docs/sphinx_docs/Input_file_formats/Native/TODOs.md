TODOs/WIP

1. Types
    * Type annotations: document
    * Function types: add notes about them. They are not first-class values
    * Basic types: add notes about their implementation (memory format, ...)
    * ? Operator table for :code:`farray`
    * ADT: expand on the syntax of ADT values
2. Triggers
    * Be more precise about the semantic of triggers: exactly when are they called ?
    * Interval triggers (`{ [...] }`): document
    * Semantic triggers (`in` intervals, `|->`): document
3. Theories
    * User-defined theories: document (`theory [...] extends [...] = [...] end`, `case_split`, semantic triggers, loading preludes, ...)
    * FPA: document
4. Goals
    * `rewriting`: document
    * `cut/check`: decide if they are completely broken or not
5. BNF
    * Be more precise about all expressions
    * Create a simple file, in (restricted) BNF format, containing all of Alt-Ergo's native language syntax
