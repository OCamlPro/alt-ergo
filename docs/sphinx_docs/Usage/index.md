# Usage

## Library

Since version 2.2.0, Alt-Ergo's library is also compiled and installed. See the [API documentation] for more information.

## Run

Alt-Ergo and AltGr-Ergo are executed with the following commands,
  respectively:

        $ alt-ergo   [options] file.<ext>
        $ altgr-ergo [options] file.<ext>

The CDCL solver is now the default SAT engine. The commands below
allow to enable the old Tableaux-like SAT-solver:

        $ alt-ergo   [options] --sat-solver Tableaux file.<ext>
        $ altgr-ergo [options] --sat-solver Tableaux file.<ext>

### Files extensions
Alt-Ergo supports file extensions:
- `.ae`, for its native input language (`.why` and `.mlw` are now depreciated although still accepted)
- `.psmt2`, `.smt2` for (our polymorphic extension of) the SMT-LIB 2
  standard

See the [Input section] for more information about the format of the input files

### Output
The results of an Alt-ergo's execution have the following form :
```
File "<path_to_file>/<filename>", line <l>, characters <n-m>: <status> (<time in seconde>) (<number of steps> steps) (goal <name of the goal>)
```
The status can be `Valid`, `Invalid` or `I don't know`. If the input file is in the SMT-LIB 2 format the status will be either `unsat`, `sat`, `unknown`. You can force the status to be print in the SMT-LIB 2 form with the option `--output smtlib2`.

### Plugins

See the [AB-Why3 README] file for the documentation of the AB-Why3 plugin

The Fm-Simplex plugin can be used as follows:

        $ alt-ergo --inequalities-plugin fm-simplex-plugin.cmxs [other-options] file.<ext>
        $ alt-ergo --inequalities-plugin some-path/fm-simplex-plugin.cmxs [other-options] file.<ext>

   Alt-Ergo will try to load a local plugin called
   "fm-simplex-plugin.cmxs". If this fails, Alt-Ergo tries to load it
   from the default plugins directory (run `alt-ergo --where plugins`
   to see its absolute path). You can also provide a relative or an
   absolute path as shown by the second command above. Also, you
   should replace ".cmxs" by ".cma" if you are working with bytcode
   binaries.

### Preludes

Preludes can be passed to Alt-Ergo as follows:

        $ alt-ergo --prelude p.ae --prelude some-path/q.ae [other-options] file.ae

   Alt-Ergo will try to load a local prelude called "p.ae". If this
   fails, Alt-Ergo tries to load it from the default preludes
   directory (run `alt-ergo --where preludes` to see its absolute
   path). You can also provide a relative or an absolute path as shown
   by "some-path/q.ae".

   For instance, the following command-line enables floating-point
   arithmetic reasoning in Alt-Ergo and indicates that the FPA prelude
   should be loaded:

        $ alt-ergo --use-fpa --prelude fpa-theory-2017-01-04-16h00.ae <file.ae>

### Plugins and Preludes directories

As stated above, the `--where` option of `alt-ergo` can be used to get the absolute
path that is searched by default when looking for plugins and preludes that were
given with a relative path. It is useful to know that these two directories are
actually relative to the location of the `alt-ergo` executable, so that the
executable, as well as preludes and plugins, can be relocated.

For instance, on a Linux system, assuming the `alt-ergo` executable is at some path
`some/path/bin/alt-ergo`, theses directories are respectively located at
`some/path/share/alt-ergo/plugins/` and `some/path/share/alt-ergo/preludes/`.
On windows, a binary at path `Z:\some\path\bin\alt-ergo` will look for preludes and
plugins in `Z:\some\path\share\alt-ergo\preludes` and
`Z:\some\path\share\alt-ergo\plugins` respectively.
