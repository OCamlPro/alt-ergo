Alt-Ergo's native language
==========================

This page documents Alt-Ergo's native input language and its syntax.

In order to state a problem, the user may enrich the signature of the theory by :doc:`adding new symbols <01_declaration_of_symbols>` and :doc:`types <02_types/index>`, using keywords such as `logic` and `type`. :doc:`Axioms <03_declaration_of_axioms>` can be declared through the `axiom` construct, and :doc:`goals <04_setting_goals>` are set with `goal`.
Additional constructs allow to define :doc:`theories <05_theories>` or to use :doc:`if-then-else, let-bindings or pattern-matching <06_control_flow>`.
A full description of the syntax is available in :doc:`the last chapter <07_syntax_of_declarations_and_expressions>`.
