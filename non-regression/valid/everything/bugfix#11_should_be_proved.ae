Here although the pivot is a |-> g(f(b,z)), 
f(a,z) |-> f(g(f(b,z)),z) should also be considered as a pivot
to correctly update use table. In fact, entry
f(a,z) ---> { g(f(a,z)) } should become
f(g(f(b,z)),z) ---> { g(f(a,z)) } , otherwise the congruence

g(f(a,z)) = g(f(b,z)) will not be deduced with the equality below,
and we will not conclude.
