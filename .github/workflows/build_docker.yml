name: Build with ocp Docker container

# The goal of this workflow is to test the installation of the project with opam
# on a specific light docker container instead of using default GH-actions one.

    # Retrieve and use a light docker container on which ocaml 4.10 is installed
    # as a system compiler. This container also contains opam 2.1.

      # Create a switch with the system compiler (no compilation needed).
      # And then, install external (no need for depext with opam 2.1) and libs deps.
      - run: opam switch create . ocaml-system --deps-only

      # Install the project packages
      - run: opam install .
