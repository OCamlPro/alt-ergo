Solvers of this family have made impressive advances and became very popular during the last decade. They are now used is various domains such as hardware design, software verification and formal testing. It was developed at [LRI](https://www.lri.fr/), and is now improved and maintained at [OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com/), and friendly collaboration is maintained with the Why3 development team.
