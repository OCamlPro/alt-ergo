(** Heaps.

    This modules define intrusive priority heaps (i.e. priority heaps where the
    index of a given element in the map is stored on the element itself).
*)

(** {2 Ranked types}

    Elements that are put in a heap must implement the {!RankedType} interface.
    This requires providing a (loose) comparison function, and allows to get and
    set an `index` field on the element (to map back the element to its current
    position in the heap).

    Note that this implies that each element can only be in a single heap at a
    time. *)

  (** Index of the element in the heap. Returns -1 if the element is not in
      the heap. *)

  val set_index : t -> int -> unit
  (** Update the element's index in the heap. *)

  (** A total ordering function over the set elements.
      This is a two-argument function [f] such that
      [f e1 e2] is zero if the elements [e1] and [e2] are equal,
      [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
      and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2]. *)
