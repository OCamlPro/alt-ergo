(* A nest is the set of all the constructors of a mutually recursive definition
   of ADTs.

   For each type ty of a nest, we denote by S(ty) the set of all the
   constructors of this type in this nest and G(ty) the set of the constructors
   with an argument of type ty in this nest.

   Recall that a (directed) hypergraph is a set of nodes and hyperedges between
   subsets of these nodes.

   To generate our total order of a nest, we build in [build_graph] a hypergraph
   where:
   - the nodes are all the constructors of the nest;
   - for all type ty of the nest, there is a hyperedge from S(ty) to G(ty).

   In particular, our graph has exactly one outgoing hyperedge per node. *)

     the type of [id]. At the beginning, we have S = S(ty) and G = G(ty).

     all the elements of S. *)
