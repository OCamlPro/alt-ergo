(** Position in input files

    This module defines a notion of location in files.
    Note: this only specifies a position in an arbitrary file,
          it does not contain information about the file itself.
*)

type t = Lexing.position * Lexing.position
(** The type of locations, a location is made up of two position in the file,
    respectively corresponding to the beginning and end of the location. *)

val dummy : t
(** A dummy location. *)

val report : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** Report a location on the given formatter, using standard
    human-redable location reporting. *)
