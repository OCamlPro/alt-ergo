     It is the only module that knows about the details of the internal
     representation of the [union] type; all other modules only use the API
     exposed through the [Core] signature.

     As such, its correction is critical to the correction of the implementation
     as a whole; unfortunately, it is also where most of the complexity lies.

     The implementation is actually contained in the [Union] functor; the [Core]
     module itself only contain (polymorphic) type definitions to be able to
     convert values between [Union]s of different types. *)

  (* We represent intervals as a list of maximal disjoint allowed intervals with
     precise bounds and explanations justifying that the (nonempty) gaps between
     each consecutive allowed interval is forbidden.

     This induces a loss of
     precision: for instance, if [0, 4] and [10, 20] are allowed and [6, 7] is
     forbidden with justification [ex], this will "widen" the forbidden interval
     to [4+eps, 10-eps] instead; if we find that the associated value must be
     equal to [5], we will include [ex] in the conflict even though it is not
     strictly necessary. On the other hand, there are diminishing returns: we
     don't want to keep track too precisely of the forbidden intervals if they
     are not going to occur in a conflict.

     Note that this is always correct, because it is equivalent to adding
     explanations to forbidden intervals (if {m I} is impossible in any model
     where {m e} holds, it is also impossible in any model where {b both} {m e}
     and {m e'} hold). It also does not change the evaluation in the current
     context: we keep track of the bounds of allowed intervals precisely.

     We also store global lower and upper bounds for the union that are always
     valid. This is useful for the [trisection_map_to_set] function to
     communicate information about the range of values to its arguments. *)

    (* Computing the intersection follows a fairly natural, if a bit tedious,
       process: we are simply iterating on the two unions at the same time and
       computing the intersections as we go.

       Some care need to be taken of to make sure to use appropriate
       explanations. When one of the unions is enough to forbid a given
       forbidden interval, we only want to use that one (for instance, the
       intersection of [-oo; 4] with explanation [ex1] and [-oo; 10] with
       explanation [ex2] only needs explanation [ex1]). We only need to take the
       union of the explanations when the explanation in one union is used to
       skip over an interval that was allowed in the other union; for instance,
       the intersection of

        [0; 1] U !ex1 U [2; 3]

       and

        !ex2 U [4; 10]

       must be

        !(union ex1 ex2) U [2; 3]

       We need [ex1] to forbid ]1; 2[ and [ex2] to forbid [0; 1] and [2; 4].

       In addition, the current implementation respects the known global
       lower/upper bounds, which adds a low amount of complexity (everything
       before/after the global lower/upper bound can be removed without
       justification). An alternative implementation could ignore the global
       lower and upper bounds and always return [-oo, +oo] as an enclosing
       interval; which might improve efficiency of further computations. *)
