  (* The implementation below is a bit magical, so let us draft a proof
     of correctness.

     Remark 1: A binary addition [x + y] has a carry at bit position [i] iff
       the addition of the lower bits of [x] and [y] overflows. In other words,
       addition [x + y] has a carry at bit position [i] iff:

         {math x \bmod 2^i + y \bmod 2^i > 2^i}

     Remark 2: Flipping bits from [0] to [1] in the operands of a binary
       addition can only introduce new carry positions but never remove them.
       This follows from Remark 1 since flipping bit [j] from [0] to [1] adds
       [2^j] to the value, and hence either increases or does not change the
       value of [x \bmod 2^i] in the inequality above, depending on whether
       [j < i] or [j >= i] holds.

     For a bitlist [b], let us write {m m_b} the value [a.bits_set] and {m M_b}
     the value [a.bits_set + a.bits_unk].

     Definition: We say that a bit position [i] is {e known} in a set {m S}
       (not necessarily a bitlist) if has the same value for all the integers
       in {m S}.

     Theorem: If [a] and [b] are bitlists, let us denote by [a + b] the set
       {m \{ x + y \mid x \in a, y \in b \}}. Then, a bit position [i] is known
       in [a + b] iff it is known in both [a] and [b], and the values
       {m m_a + m_b} and {M_a + M_b} agree on bit [i].

     Proof (implication): Consider a bit position [i] that is known in [a + b].
       It must be known in both [a] and [b], otherwise we could flip bit [i] and
       still obtain a value in [a + b]. Moreover, since {m m_a + m_b} and
       {m M_a + M_b} is in [a + b], they must agree on bit position [i].

     Proof (reverse implication): Consider a bit position [i] that is known in
       [a] and in [b], and where {m m_a + m_b} and {m M_a + M_b} agree.
       Assume that we have {m x \in a} and {m y \in b} such that {m x + y}
       disagree with {m M_a + M_b} on bit position [i].

       Since bit [i] is known in both [a] and [b], the only difference at bit
       position [i] between {m m_a + m_b} and {m x + y} can come from one
       having a carry and not the other.

       Since [a] and [b] are bitlists, we can obtain {m x \bmod 2^i} (resp.
       {m y \bmod 2^i}) by flipping bits from [0] to [1] in {m m_a} (resp.
       {m m_a}), and we can obtain {m M_a} (resp. {m M_B})by flipping bits from
       [0] to [1] in {m x \bmod 2^i} (resp. {m y \bmod 2^i}).

       Hence, by remark 2, if {m m_a + m_b} has a carry at position [i], then
       so do {m x + y} and {m M_a + M_b}; conversely, if {m M_a + M_b} has no
       carry at position [i], then neither do {m x + y} and {m m_a + m_b}. *)

     Recall that [x - y] is [x + ~y + 1] and remark that:

       {math x + y + 1 = ((2x + 1) + (2y + 1)) / 2}

     From this last remark, we can apply the same reasoning for [a + b + 1] as
     for [a + b], and get that the unknown bits in [a + b + 1] are either
     unknown in [a], unknown in [b], or differ in [a.bits_set + b.bits_set + 1]
