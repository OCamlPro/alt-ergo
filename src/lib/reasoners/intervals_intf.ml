(** The [kind] type is an equivalent to the [result] type from the standard
    library with more appropriate constructor names.

    It is used to distinguish between unions of intervals that are empty in the
    current context (with an explanation abstracting a set of model where the
    union is also empty) and unions of intervals that have at least one value in
    the current context. *)

module type Union = sig
  (** Signature for union-of-intervals implementations {b with explanations}. *)

  (** Given an explanation {m e} (see {!Intervals_intf.Explanations}), we say
      that an interval {m I} is forbidden for a variable {m x} by {m e} if
      {m M(x)} is never in {m I} when {m M} is a model such that {m M(e)} is
      [true], i.e. if the following implication holds:

      {math \forall M, M(e) \Rightarrow M(x) \not\in I}

      Given a current context {m C} (a set of explanations) and an implicit
      variable {m x}, we say that an interval {m I} is {e forbidden} if it is
      forbidden by an union of explanations in {m C}, and that it is {e allowed}
      otherwise.

      It is always sound to weaken a forbidden interval interval: if {m M(e_1)
      \Rightarrow M(e_2)} and {m I} is forbidden by [e_2], it is also forbidden
      by [e_1].

      (Note that in terms of explanations, this means adding more terms in the
      explanation, since [Explanation.empty] is true in all contexts and since
      [Explanation.union e1 e2] evaluates to {m M(e_1) \wedge M(e_2)}.)

      The [union] type below internally keeps track of both allowed and
      forbidden intervals, where each forbidden interval is annotated by a
      specific explanation (true in the current context) that forbids it, but
      the functions in this module provide abstractions to deal with the unions
      without having to worry about explanations (and forbidden intervals)
      directly.

      In order to avoid having to worry about variables while reasoning about
      intervals, we define a contextual evaluation function for unions (and set
      of intervals); the evaluation of an allowed interval {m I} is always {m I}
      in all contexts, and the evaluation of a forbidden interval {m I} is {m I}
      in contexts where the associated explanation {b does not hold}, and the
      empty set otherwise (in particular, it is the empty set in the current
      context).

      Note that the evaluation of a forbidden interval is a subset of the
      interval in any context. *)

  (** Build an union from the complement of an interval.

      The explanation, if provided, justifies that the value is {b not} in the
      interval; the resulting union evaluates to the complement of the interval
      in any model where the explanation holds, and to the full set otherwise.

      If the provided interval covers the full domain, the resulting union is
      empty and an [Empty] kind is returned; otherwise, the resulting union is
      [NonEmpty]. *)

  (** {1 Inspection}

      union of intervals. *)

  val lower_bound : t -> value bound * explanation

      explanation that justifies that this upper bound is valid. *)

  val value_opt : t -> (value * explanation) option
  (** If [u] is a singleton {b in the current context}, [value_opt u] returns a
      pair [(v, ex)] where [v] is the value of [u] in the current context and

  (** [partial_map_inc f_lb f_ub u] computes the image of [u] by a partial

      [f], and [f_ub x < f_lb x] otherwise.

      increasing. Moreover, the inequality [f_ub x <= f_lb x] must hold
      everywhere; if [f_lb] and [f_ub] are imprecise approximations of [f], use
      {!approx_map_inc_to_set} instead. *)

  val partial_map_dec :

  (** [partial_map_dec f_lb f_ub u] computes the image of [u] by a partial

  (** {1 Image by arbitrary functions}

      When computing the image of an union by non-monotone functions and
      multi-variate functions, work needs to be done to convert intermediate
      results into a normalized form of disjoint intervals (because applying the
      function to initially disjoint intervals can create arbitrary unions).

      In such cases, the following family of [to_set] functions should be used.
      The use the [set] type to represent intermediate results, which can be
      converted back to an union using the [of_set] family of functions as
      needed. *)

  type set
  (** The [set] type represents a (possibly empty) set of intervals.

      Unlike an [union], it is not normalized: it is an intermediate type not
      intended to be manipulated directly, except in the process of building an
      union. Use the [of_set] family of functions to convert it to an union as
      needed. *)

  val empty_set : set
  (** [empty_set] represents an empty set of intervals. *)

  val interval_set : bnd interval -> set
  (** [interval_set i] represents the interval [i] as a [set]. *)

  val union_set : set -> set -> set

  val of_set_checked : set -> (t, explanation) kind
  (** Converts a [set] to a nonempty union. Returns [Empty ex] if the set is
      currently empty, and [NonEmpty u] otherwise.

      If a [NonEmpty] value is returned, the resulting union is guaranteed to be
      nonempty in the current context. *)

  val of_set_nonempty : set -> t
  (** Converts a [set] to an union, assuming that it is nonempty in the current
      context.

      @raise Invalid_argument if the [set] represents an union that is empty in
      the current context. *)

  val map_to_set : ('a interval -> set) -> 'a union -> set
  (** [map_to_set f u] computes the image of [u] by [f].

      Conceptually, this computes the union of [f x] for each [x] in [u],
      although this is not possible to compute when [u] might not be finite.
      Instead, we represent [f] by a function from intervals to sets that must
      be isotone (i.e. monotone with respect to inclusion):

      {math I_1 \subseteq I_2 \Rightarrow f(I_1) \subseteq f(I_2)}

      There are no restrictions on [f] (except that it be isotone), which means
      that [map_to_set] needs to call [f] on currently allowed intervals, but
      also on some intervals that are currently impossible but would be possible
      in other contexts (depending on explanations).

      When possible, prefer using a more specialized variant of
      [map_to_set] that use properties of the function [f] to avoid
      certain calls to [f]. *)

  val map_mon_to_set : ('a interval -> set) -> 'a union -> set
  (** [map_mon_to_set] is a variant of [map_to_set] when the

      More precisely, we require that for any pair of intervals [(i1, i2)] the
      interval hull of [f i1] and [f i2] is included in the image of the
      interval hull of [i1] and [i2] by [f].

      It is often more convenient to use [approx_map_inc_to_set] or
      [approx_map_dec_to_set] instead, to lift a function on values to a
      function on unions without going through intervals. *)

  val approx_map_inc_to_set : ('a -> bnd) -> ('a -> bnd) -> 'a union -> set
  (** [approx_map_inc_to_set f_lb f_ub u] is a variant of [map_to_set] that is

      [(f_lb, f_ub)] of functions such that for all [x] in the domain of [f],
      [f_lb x <= f x <= f_ub x] (and [f_ub x < f_lb x] otherwise).

      Note that, unlike [partial_map_inc], this function can be used with
      imprecise approximations: we allow [f_lb x < f x < f_ub x] (this is useful
      for radicals). *)
