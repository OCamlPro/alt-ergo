      In addition, some terms (e.g. [true], [false], [void]) that have no

      Semantic value for which [is_constant] returns [true] contains no free
      names and thus have the same concrete value in all contexts.

  (**[assign_value r distincts eq] selects the value to assign to [r] in the
     model as a term [t], and returns [Some (t, is_cs)]. [is_cs] is described
     below.

     If no appropriate value can be chosen here, return [None] (only do this if
     either [r] is already a value, or there is a mechanism somewhere else in
     the code, such as the [case_split] function of a relation module, that
     ensures completeness of the generated model).

     [r] is the current class representative that a value should be chosen for.
     No assumptions should be made on the shape of [r], but do return [None] if
     it is already a value.

     [distincts] is a list of term representatives that the returned value must
     be distinct from (choosing a value that is present in [distincts] will
     cause the solver to loop infinitely).

     [eq] is a list of pairs [(t, r)] of terms and their initial representative
     (i.e., [r] is [fst (X.make t)] for each pair) that encode the equivalence
     class of [r].

     The returned bool serves a similar purpose as the [is_cs] flag in
     [Th_util.case_split].

     It should usually be [true], which indicates that the returned term is not
     forced.

     Use [false] only when the returned term contains aliens that should be
     assigned (e.g. records).

     **When returning [false], you must ensure that the equality between the
     first argument and the return value always hold (i.e. is a *unit* fact).
     In particular, the equality *must not* depend on [distincts] -- doing so
     would be unsound.**

     In other words, if [assign_value r distincts eq] returns
     [Some (t, false)], then there must be no context in which
     [solve r (fst X.make t)] raises [Unsolvable]. You have been warned! *)

      The function cannot fail if [r] is a constant (that is statisfied the

      [Expr.is_model_term]. See its documentation for more details about
