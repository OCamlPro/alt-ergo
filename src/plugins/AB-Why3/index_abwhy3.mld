{1 ABWhy3 plugin}

{2 What is this plugin ?}

An experimental front-end that parses a subset of Why3's logic. More
precisely, this front-end targets proof obligations generated by the
Atelier-B framework in Why3 format. It should be used with a prelude
defining the B Set theory (currently provided in
[preludes/b-set-theory-prelude-2020-02-28.ae]).


{2 What this plugin is not ?}

This plugin mainly focuses on the shape of the proof obligations
produced by the Why3 proofs obligations generator of Atelier-B. You
will probably not be able to use it to parse/solve other formulas
written in Why3's logic.



{2 How to use it ?}

Assuming you are currently in [alt-ergo-git/sources] directory, and
[make && make AB-Why3] succeeded, you can ask Alt-Ergo to
prove the goals given in a file [b-why3-POs.why] with the following
command:


{v
 ./alt-ergo b-why3-POs.why --add-parser AB-Why3-plugin.cmxs --prelude preludes/b-set-theory-prelude-2020-02-28.ae
v}


where [--add-parser=AB-Why3-plugin.cmxs] allows to load this plugin and
register the parser it contains, and [--prelude
preludes/b-set-theory-prelude-2020-02-28.ae] provides an axiomatization of the B Set
theory for Alt-Ergo.

For instance, using the following command to prove the goals in the
file [examples/AB-Why3-plugin/p4_34.why.zip]:

{v
./alt-ergo examples/AB-Why3-plugin/p4_34.why.zip --add-parser AB-Why3-plugin.cmxs --prelude preludes/b-set-theory-prelude-2020-02-28.ae --timelimit-per-goal --timelimit 3 --no-locs-in-answers
v}

Alt-Ergo returns:

{v
Warning: A parser for extension ".why" is already registered. It will be hidden !

v}

If you have already installed this version of Alt-Ergo and this plugin, you should be able to simply use the command:


[
 alt-ergo b-why3-POs.why --parser AB-Why3-plugin.cmxs --prelude b-set-theory-prelude-2020-02-28.ae
]
